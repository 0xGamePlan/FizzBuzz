This is a version of the algorithm known as FizzBuzz using Java.

The algorithm, in this instance, prints numbers from 1 to 200.
If the number is a multiple of 3, it prints Fizz.
If the number is a multiple of 5, it prints Buzz.
If the number is a multiple of 3 and 5, it prints FizzBuzz.
In all other cases, it prints the number itself.
